## I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Prior Dismissed Cases (Precedent)

On August 27, 2025, NYC DOT held administrative hearings for five (5) summonses issued on April 6, 2025, charging violations of Code ADG4 - "Fail to Obtain Proper Permit to Repair Condition Reported on CAR." The locations for these violations were:

1. **Summons 703860951** - 114 Road and 226 Street, Queens NY
2. **Summons 703860960** - 114 Road between 225 Street and Queens NY
3. **Summons 703860989** - 114 Road and 227 Street, Queens NY
4. **Summons 703861007** - 114 Road between 226 Street and Queens NY
5. **Summons 703861016** - 114 Road between 227 Street and C, Queens NY

**ALL FIVE CASES WERE DISMISSED** following the hearing.

### B. Current Defaulted Cases (Subject of This Appeal)

On June 16, 2025 - merely two months after the first set of violations - NYC DOT issued five (5) additional summonses for the **identical ADG4 violation** at the **same exact locations**:

1. **Summons 703922369** - 114 Road between 227 Street and C, Queens NY - **$1,500.00**
2. **Summons 703922414** - 114 Road between 226 Street and Queens NY - **$1,500.00**
3. **Summons 703922432** - 114 Road between 225 Street and Queens NY - **$1,500.00**
4. **Summons 703922441** - 114 Road and 226 Street, Queens NY - **$1,500.00**
5. **Summons 703922460** - 114 Road and 227 Street, Queens NY - **$1,500.00**

Hearing date for these violations was September 24, 2025, which was unfortunately missed, resulting in default judgments.

## II. LEGAL ARGUMENT

### A. Identical Facts Warrant Identical Outcomes

The fundamental principle of administrative law requires that similarly situated parties receive consistent treatment. *See Binghamton-Perry Chamber of Commerce v. Village of Endicott*, 47 A.D.2d 49, 52 (3d Dept 1975) (administrative agencies must apply rules consistently and cannot arbitrarily treat similar cases differently).

**The facts here are indistinguishable:**

| Element | April 2025 (DISMISSED) | June 2025 (DEFAULTED) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Violation Code** | ADG4 | ADG4 (IDENTICAL) |
| **Description** | Fail to obtain proper permit | Fail to obtain proper permit (IDENTICAL) |
| **Location** | 114 Road, 225-227 St, Queens | 114 Road, 225-227 St, Queens (IDENTICAL) |
| **Time Period** | April 2025 | June 2025 (2 months later) |
| **Respondent** | Same entity | Same entity (IDENTICAL) |
| **Hearing Outcome** | DISMISSED | DEFAULTED (hearing missed) |

The **only difference** between these two sets of violations is that the respondent attended the August 27, 2025 hearing and did not attend the September 24, 2025 hearing. The underlying facts, locations, and circumstances are **completely identical**.

### B. Procedural Default Does Not Change Substantive Facts

While it is true that the September 24, 2025 hearings resulted in defaults due to non-appearance, this procedural deficiency does not alter the fundamental fact that:

**If the violations issued in April 2025 were determined to lack merit and were dismissed, then the violations issued in June 2025 - for the identical conduct at identical locations - must likewise lack merit.**

The purpose of default judgments is to provide efficiency in the administrative process, not to enable the City to obtain financial penalties for conduct that has already been determined to be non-violative.

### C. Collateral Estoppel / Issue Preclusion Principles

While formal collateral estoppel may not strictly apply in this administrative context, the equitable principles underlying that doctrine are instructive. When an administrative body has determined that certain conduct does not constitute a violation, fundamental fairness dictates that the same conduct should not result in penalties simply because a subsequent hearing was missed.

The City had a full and fair opportunity to prove the violations at the August 27, 2025 hearing. The Administrative Law Judge determined that the evidence did not support the charges. The facts have not changed.

### D. Equal Protection and Arbitrary Action

To impose $7,500 in penalties for conduct that was previously determined not to constitute a violation would constitute arbitrary and capricious administrative action. *See Matter of Pell v. Board of Educ.*, 34 N.Y.2d 222 (1974) (administrative decisions that are arbitrary and unreasonable violate due process).

The respondent should not be subjected to different outcomes based solely on attendance at hearings when the underlying substantive facts are identical and have already been adjudicated in respondent's favor.

## III. REQUEST FOR RELIEF

Based on the foregoing, respondent respectfully requests that the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings:

1. **VACATE** the default judgments entered for Summons Numbers 703922369, 703922414, 703922432, 703922441, and 703922460;

2. **DISMISS** all five summonses with prejudice, consistent with the dismissals granted for the identical violations in August 2025;

3. **ELIMINATE** all outstanding balances totaling $7,500.00;

4. Grant any other relief the tribunal deems just and proper.

## V. CONCLUSION

The respondent acknowledges the procedural default but respectfully submits that imposing penalties for conduct that has already been determined to be non-violative would be fundamentally unjust. The facts are identical, the locations are identical, and the City's own Administrative Law Judge determined that similar charges should be dismissed.

**Consistency and fairness demand that these five defaulted cases receive the same outcome as the five dismissed cases that preceded them.**

Respectfully submitted,

[Respondent Name]
[Date]
